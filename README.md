# ljscrapper
Scrapper for LiveJournal blogs (it only scraps articles' titles and dates).

## Details
- Since LJ doesn't have a proper API, this tool can be useful if you are carefully reading some blogs.
- Right now this script only stores its data in {blogname}.json file per blog

## Examples


## TODO
- Add tags scrapping
- Add conversion to html-page with all the links
- Add DB support
